Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:
AI models require data preprocessing steps like data cleaning and feature engineering to optimize performance. This includes selecting relevant features and transforming them into a suitable format for the model. 
Machine Learning Techniques:
Algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are commonly used for stock price prediction. 
Historical Data Analysis:
AI algorithms can analyze historical stock prices and other market data to identify patterns and trends that can help predict future movements. 
Improved Accuracy:
AI models can learn complex patterns and relationships in data, leading to more accurate predictions than traditional methods. 
Automation:
AI can automate the analysis and prediction process, freeing up human analysts to focus on more strategic tasks. 
Risk Management:
AI can help identify potential risks and adjust portfolios accordingly to mitigate potential losses.
